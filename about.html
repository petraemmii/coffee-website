                <p>When choosing a theme for my final web development project, I kept coming back to coffee. Not because it's trendy or complex, but because it's simple, authentic, and something I genuinely care about.</p>

                        <h4>😰 What I Struggled With Most</h4>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>CSS Cascade & Specificity:</strong> Understanding why some styles worked and others didn't—especially when Bootstrap and my custom CSS conflicted. This took hours of trial and error.</li>
                            <li><strong>Debugging:</strong> Learning to systematically find problems instead of randomly changing code and hoping it would work.</li>
                            <li><strong>Responsive Design:</strong> Making everything look good on different screen sizes felt like solving a puzzle where the pieces kept changing shape.</li>
                            <li><strong>GitHub Pages Deployment:</strong> What works locally doesn't always work online. That was a frustrating discovery.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </div>

                    <div class="journey-block time-consuming">
                        <h4>⏰ What Took Most of My Time</h4>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Styling and Polish:</strong> Making things "look right" took exponentially longer than building the basic structure.</li>
                            <li><strong>Understanding Concepts:</strong> Not just copying code, but actually understanding WHY it works that way.</li>
                            <li><strong>Fixing Small Details:</strong> Spacing, alignment, colors - the tiny things that make the difference between "works" and "looks professional."</li>
                        </ul>
                    </div>

                        <h4>✨ What Excited Me</h4>

                            <li><strong>Seeing It Come to Life:</strong> That moment when the hover effect finally worked, or the responsive grid snapped into place - Pure joy!</li>
                            <li><strong>Creative Control:</strong> Being able to design exactly what I imagined, choosing colors and layouts that felt right.</li>
                            <li><strong>"Aha!" Moments:</strong> Finally understanding why something works after struggling with it for hours.</li>
                            <li><strong>Building Something Real:</strong> This isn't just an exercise - it's a real website about something I care about.</li>

                            <li><strong>Feeling Overwhelmed:</strong> Staring at a long list of tasks and not knowing where to start.</li>

                <h3>☕ Final Thoughts</h3>
                <p>Building this coffee-themed website taught me more than just HTML and CSS - it taught me patience, problem-solving, and the value of persistence. Every struggle was a lesson. Every error message was a teacher. Every successful hover effect was a celebration.</p>
                <p>If you're reading this and learning to code too: it's okay to struggle. It's okay to Google things. It's okay to take breaks. It's okay to ask for help. That's not weakness - that's how learning actually works.</p>
